# Description

This is the code for a dynamic election map that was made using a freely available CSV data from [MIT Election Labs](https://electionlab.mit.edu/), featuring elections ranging from 1976 to 2016. The program is written using Processing3, which utilizes Java. The bar graphs for each state are scaled dynamically according to the election data present.

## Installation

The program can be run so long as [Processing3](https://processing.org/download/) and Java is installed by clicking on the PDE file.
